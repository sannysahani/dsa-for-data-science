# DSA for Data Science — 8-Week Track (100 curated)

This repo tracks my *moderate-depth* DSA practice tailored for **data science** roles: arrays/strings/hashmaps, two-pointers/sliding-window, sorting/searching, trees/graphs, and DP basics. I’ll add problems **week by week**, each with a short note explaining *why the pattern matters in DS/ML* and the complexity.

## How this repo is organized
```

## Per-problem note format (copy `TEMPLATES/problem-README.md`)
- **Pattern**: (e.g., “Hash map for O(1) complement lookup”)
- **Why it matters in DS/ML**: one sentence tying to ETL/feature/analytics
- **Time/Space**: tight Big-O
- **Edge cases**: focused bullets
- **Related DS task**: short phrase (e.g., “dedupe log windows”)

## Naming convention
- **Weeks**: `weeks/week-01-02-fundamentals/`, `weeks/week-03-sorting-searching/`, ...  
- **Problems** (inside a week): `NN-kebab-name-<leetcode-id>/`  
  - Example: `01-two-sum-1/`, `02-subarray-sum-equals-k-560/`.
